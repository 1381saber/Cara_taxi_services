# Cara_taxi_services
This project provides a brief overview of an online taxi service app named Cara, similar to Uber, Snapp and Tapsi with Html5 and CSS3 and a little JavaScript. The app provides a platform for users to request rides from nearby drivers, track the ride in real-time, and pay for the service through the app.

    Sign up and log in for both drivers and passengers
    Real-time map view of available taxis and their current location
    Ride request and acceptance system
    Payment gateway integration
    Ride history and rating system
